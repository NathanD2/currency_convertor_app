# currency_convertor_app
A basic temperature conversion application using python.

During development, I exercised my experience with python. I also experimented with the use of classes and python's
built-in module Tkinter to build my first GUI.

Currency data taken from API from https://api.exchangeratesapi.io/latest.

Initial vision had a real-time conversion application. Future versions may include this feature.
